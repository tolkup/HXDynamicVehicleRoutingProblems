Problem File Details :

- "delivery" subset includes informations about all location nodes and deliveries.
- "vehicle" subset includes informations about all vehicles.
- "detail" subset includes informations about problem details such as problem delivery startTime, endTime.
- The node with "deliveryID" = 0 represents the cross-dock.
- Nodes with "market" = true represent market locations (time-windowed fast delivery collection points).
- Nodes with "marketDelivery" = true represent market deliveries (time-windowed fast deliveries).
- The "orderTime" key represents the time when the order was placed and details arrived at the cross-dock.
- The "serviceTime" key represents the required service time for delivering the relevant delivery, in seconds.
- The "productCode" key distinguishes the relevant product type of the delivery. HX_EX stands for time-windowed fast deliveries, and HX_STD stands for standard shipments.
- The "marketId" key represents the relevant collection point ID for market (time-windowed fast delivery) deliveries.
